# Next.js 13 Starter

**This Next.js 13 starter repo is designed to help spin up new projects quickly.**

This is the starter repo I use for my own projects. A solid foundation of popular technologies (NextJS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) means you can focus on building the features that matter most to your project right away.

I've purposfully left it relatively lightweight, so you can add what you need as you go.

## Why no test tooling?

I specifically didn't include some packages in order to keep this project lightweight and versatile. This makes it a bit more flexible and allows you to add what you need while still giving you a solid front end baseline.
